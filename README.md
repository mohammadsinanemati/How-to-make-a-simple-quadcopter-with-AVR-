# How-to-make-a-simple-quadcopter-with-AVR-
This project involves designing and building a simple quadcopter using an ATmega64 microcontroller. An MPU6050 sensor sends orientation data via IÂ²C, which is processed by a PID algorithm to maintain stability. PWM signals control four brushless motors through ESCs, while commands are received via a wireless module.
